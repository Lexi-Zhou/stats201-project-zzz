H. Adam  Lenz,University of Central Florida,Digital Arts,"First,he is basically teaching Adams class for her because she can not be in two places at once. He seems disinterested in the class and is incredibly vague about projects. One major problem is they DO NOT teach you Photoshop at all, if you don\'t know it at all find a friend and learn it. The labs are only for critiques, not for learning"
Megan  Hess,Tacoma Community College,Chemistry,"Literally the best teacher I have ever had. I didn\'t even have to buy the book because she was so thorough. Very understanding, my cat ran away, and she let me leave class to go find him. Chemistry is not the same without her. Wish she taught organic here!"
Jeffrey  Gray,University of New Orleans,Engineering,Reads straight from the book word for work. Does not know the subject at all Passes the female students in hopes of getting into their underware. Will fail male students in a heart beat. Looks homeless
Whendee  Silver,University of California Berkeley,Environ. Sci. Policy & Mgmt.,"One of two professors for this class, the other being Dennis Baldocchi. Whendee doesn\'t use powerpoint so if you miss her lecture you\'re somewhat out of luck. Compared to Dennis, she\'s terse but she\'s not scary or anything like that. He\'s just more relatable. When she\'s not the one giving lecture, she\'ll show up but often leave as soon as possible"
Lorne  Olfman,Claremont Graduate University,Information Science,Excellent and encourging professor. He really values the student and his or her opinions. Always welcomes new information and discussions in class. He always gives feedback about progress. This course was a lot of fun too :)
Harry  Collis,College of San Mateo,Foreign Languages,"There is no way you can take this class and not come out speaking and loving to speak Spanish. Harry really tries hard to make sure each student does his or her best and has a good time doing it. He works hard in getting you to speak like a native Spanish speaker. By far, the best Spanish teacher at CSM. Don\'t waste time on the others.Been there."
Margie  Gray,Lake\xe2\x80\x93Sumter State College,Psychology,"Ms. Gray is nice. Seems new to teaching. She does not spend much time lecturing & has no outline when she does. She barely covers 10% of the textbook. The student is on his own to learn the material. Quizzes & tests seem to be produced by the publisher. Class format is basically read, quiz, test. I would look for a more experienced instructor."
Jenna  Nyholt De Prada,Cosumnes River College,Biology,man! you can so tell that the students that complain about jenna are the ones that want the easy way out! hello people!! Bio431 was never an easy class to start with and jenna is an awesome teacher! she gives you extra credit and study handouts that are basically test questions very helpful & approachable! DEFINATELY RECOMMEND HER!!!
Maureen  Demaio,University of California Santa Barbara,Music,"She\'s def a good prof, makes the notes clear and helps u remember the musical devices. As a music minor, it wasn\'t hard for me, even for those taking it to fulfill their Arts req its pretty easy. Fulfills writing req broken up into 3 short papers which rly helps. Vincent isn\'t that bad of a TA, if u go to office hrs he rly helps u on the paper."
Diane  Marano,Rutgers - State University of New Jersey,Criminal Justice,The first couple of weeks of her class I didn\'t know what was going on.S he had a guest speakers every week (and none of the material was on the test). So all you have to do is read the text and it is an easy A!!! Don\'t get me wrong her class is interesting and she is such a sweet lady even though..their is never a dumb ques. in her class.
Kevin  McMahon,NHTI,Criminal Justice,"Turned Introductory to Forensic Science into Advanced Forensic Science! Dose not accept any thing but 1000%. You have to memorize the book, to pass with a ""C"" or ""B"". One woman had a 4 GPA and it brought her down to 3.4! He is very good at forensic science but, needs to take some teaching, and communication classes."
Sahar  Aldujaili,Henry Ford College,Biology,"Great professor and very helpful. I was nervous at first but she turned out to be great. I guess the student with the negative comment was one with an F on his/her transcript. If you do the work, it is an easy A."
Heidi  Smithson,University of Regina,Engineering,"a student just asked how to start an assignment, she started cackling like a witch and started mocking him. any future engineers, good luck! u cant avoid her but u can rate her! lol"
Henry  McDade,Shelton State Community College,Psychology,"My friend came to the first two classes and she dropped the class. Her quote was ""this guy is going to make this class hell"" she was right. I wish I had only listened its been only 4 weeks and I\'ve never seen so many people drop a class so soon"
Henry  McDade,Shelton State Community College,Psychology,"My friend came to the first two classes and she dropped the class. Her quote was ""this guy is going to make this class hell"" she was right. I wish I had only listened its been only 4 weeks and more people have dropped than I\'ve ever seen this early"
Luisa  Forrest,Richland College,Philosophy,"Extremely unprofessional, she brought a dog in on the first day of class.(this is not a petting zoo, please just teach) A student asked a question regarding MLA formatting saying that he could not find any resources to help him - she flipped out and started saying ""what internet are you using?"" - just answer his Q after class really disrespectful."
Ariene  David,California Lutheran University,Business,"She\'s very intelligent and a great communicator. Interesting lectures. Although, so many assignments due each week and so much reading and research. You will also do one presentation each week. So much work and it\'s not a quantitative class. Why? Too much work grading is tough. You won\'t get an A since she grades tough on word usage. Tough! Take he"
John  Kozarski,Community College of Baltimore County,Mathematics,"If you respect him, he will respect you. There was a hispanic woman in my class who had problems formulating her questions. Whenever she had problems getting her words out he said, "" I answer questions, not comments."" Make sure you know what you want to ask before you raise your hand to avoid hearing that belittling statement at all costs."
Nicole  Maurantonio,University of Richmond,Communication Studies,"Um, I have no idea what that last guy was talking about, but I was in that class and I think that I know who wrote it. Hilarious! He\'s SO wrong. Prof. Maurantonio is AWESOME. She\'s smart, she\'s funny, and she knows what she\'s talking about. Yes, she\'s young, but that\'s cool. Take her class!"
John  Coleman,Los Angeles Harbor College,Philosophy,"Google John E. Coleman and decide for yourselves. Ladies, I\'m especially interested in his comments about woman. I find it ironic that he is teaching Ethics. His core beliefs completely contradict his teachings. www.johnecoleman.org"
Eddie  Tapia,Full Sail University,Writing,Into himself big time. Class is his lime light to shine. Never stays in one place. Walk around classroom way to much. Talks about his wife more than she would like for to him to mention probably. Never on time. Break time is for him. Never available during class to ask questions. Tells stories a lot that do not seem true. Has no business teaching.
Kerri  Horine,Bellarmine University,English,i think she\'s an excellent teacher and very well spoken very well organized and helps students comprehend th e topic. i think the jackass got her mixed up with another professor or he just never showed up so hes inappropriate and should have his brain examine!!!
Sean  Cunningham,Macomb Community College (all campuses),Sociology,I went into this class not knowing much but he was very understanding and a kind person learned alot even though a girl in the class would fall asleep and then blame him for not learning anything even with all of that he still helped her to pass would highly recommend this class
Sean  Cunningham,Macomb Community College (all campuses),Sociology,"Agreed. If you are an attractive woman then you will ace his class. He uses a lot of ""big words"" and I felt as though he was trying to impress us with them. Sometimes they really took away from the lesson, because you had to stop just to think about what he had just said."
Lisa  Kohnhorst,De Anza College,English As A Second Language,"Pretty cool teacher!Take her class and you\'ll see...easy A.By the way, her husband is cool too.My friend took her husband\'s class and completely had fun with him.Kohnhorst is her husband\'s last name,so dont misunderstand between 2 people.I saw some comment said ""he is..."" <== LMAO!"
Panagiotis  Velissariou,The Ohio State University,Civil Engineering,this guy is nearly impossible to understand and the material is difficult. he snapped and cussed our class out. he does not give the TA any material and asks us not to talk to her. i would reccommend avoiding this professor if possible.
Kamaljeet  Sanghera,George Mason University,Information Technology,I would not suggest to anyone to take her online class. I\'m sure he is a good professor in person but I would not take her online. She is not as organized and there is going to be a lack of communication.
Kathleen  Kemmerer,Bloomsburg University,English,This is honestly the most idiotic person that have ever encountered. I spent 2 hours on a 5 page paper and got a B and my friend actually spent time on his and got a C- (and I am not good at writing). She also stares blankly into space for no reason. Avoid her.
Xiangrong  Li,University of California Irvine,Mathematics,"very very very bad teacher. he\'s smart but he cant explain what he means. lecture notes is like a whole book itself, txtbook useless. cant answer questions.unreasonable amount of hw. refuse to go slower to stick w/ his agenda though half of d class got lost already. class is not supposed to b hard but he made it hard. Take Baochi if she teach it."
Anthony  Lilly,Sweet Briar College,English,Lilly isn\'t bad but a little preachy and even for an all female school a bit too feminist. Other than that though he is a decent professor.
Peter  Sprano,Wytheville Community College,English,"I\'ve honestly never hated a Literature class until I had to take this one. I enjoy writing and reading the material, BUT he\'s completely unorganized and takes forever to respond to anything. Take the class with Martha, she\'d be a lot better then he is. His teaching style is very unique and keep up with the reading, honestly."
Joanne  Frazier,Montgomery College: Rockville Campus,Management,"She is amazing, smart, and sweet. take her if you wanna be a business man in the future good job professor"
Tim  Crain,University of Massachusetts,Music,"His teaching style makes you cram and regurgitate: he goes through a powerpoint once and then calls you ""experts"" and moves on. Most of his policies are insensitive to the abilities of the average student, probably because he as a student was so above-average. One gets the feeling he/she is being quickly dragged through the material."
Erica  Tyler,Folsom Lake College,Anthropology,I took Professor Tyler\'s 8 week hybrid. The class was graded entirely on the online work. and discussions every week. All of he answers to every quiz or online or in the book. If you keep up with the course work you will get an A. I highly recommend taking her!
Erica  Tyler,Folsom Lake College,Anthropology,"I absolutely loved Erica! She was out for almost a month on leave so that was a bummer but he lectures are really fun and engaging. Her quizzes are easy, all online! I would highly recommend taking her!"
Sally  Farley,University of Baltimore,Behavioral Sciences,"She is very good, helpful, and knows what\'s she talking about.. He test are hard, she ask concept questions, so studying is very important.."
Mark  Simpson,University of North Florida,Ethnic Studies,"OH MY GOD. He is super hot and he is super smart. Philosophy can be boring, but looking at him for 2 hours is paradise. If you are a girl or a woman, or a guy men, you MUST take this teacher. Plus, he knows he stuff."
Mahajan  Amita,San Antonio College,Computer Science,"Man, if ever there was a pointless class, it\'s this one. And what\'s worse is that she makes it really complicated - waaaay more complicated than it is. It\'s the BEGINNING of the semester and I already hate her."
Brian  Livingston,California State University Long Beach,Biological Sciences,"My friend was in love with Dr. Livingston. Well actually, she still is in love with him. He\'s a good professor. Study his studyguides and you\'ll be fine for the test. He doesn\'t try to trick you or anything. Great professor overall. His lectures were interesting, but my friend kept distracting me by saying ""Dr. L is so hot."""
Bolaji  Thomas,Rochester Institute of Technology,Biology,"Sped through lectures, spending more time talking about he family and his trips to Africa than the topic. Ended once class with a tirade about how we should all abstain from sex and how his fife had done so so he loved her more for that. Incredibly awkward, tests were ridiculous, avoid if at all possible. Made me hate the class."
Kathleen  Kollman,Wright State University,English,"My roommate told me to take her, and now im glad i listen to him. This class was really fun to go to and enjoyed it every bit. I would take her again!"
Jin Ok  Lee,City College of New York,Music,"TAKE HER!attendance is man. She\'s funny, and extremly helpful. Take notes in class and those notes are on her four quizzes, go over the quizzes(she gives back with corrections) and thats the final. simple! theres a 10 minute final presentation. you need to go to two classical or jazz concerts, one in city college, one out of city.2 page paper each!"
Jorge  Perez,University of Kansas,Spanish & Portuguese,"Jorge is hilarious and so so fun. You can get on his good side particularly if you\'re already familiar with accents & if you know anything about feminism or strong female figures from Spanish history. He\'s very engaging & full of jokes. Seems intimidating at first, but is actually very friendly and helpful."
Angaluki  Muaka,University of Minnesota-Twin Cities,Global Studies,"I am not his student, my wife is! I have attended his class. He is an amzing guy in person, and I really like his teaching styles. My wife is doing very well even though she had absolutely no background of the language she is taking with him. I really recommend anybody to take his classes"
Julia  Wolf,Rutgers - State University of New Jersey,Mathematics,"Good teacher. Representative upper level math course. Difficult, but with effort, you can get it. She really wants us to do well and puts in effort to help. Plus it\'s pretty cool to be taught by a 20-something year old chick than an old, stuffy man who barely speaks English. The accent rocks, I can hear it in my sleep."
Linda  Hurkmans,Mission College,Psychology,"Ms. Hurkmans is a great teacher. She is very nice and treats all her students equally unlike Cormier, he goes easy on students that participates or if they are a girl. Ms. Hurkmans is a lot easier to understand. I am not very intelligent but I have learned a lot from her. She is a recommended teacher for all students. I am an honest guy."
Jaurequi  Lopez,Santa Ana College,Spanish,"THIS IS A REALLY EASY CLASS. NO KIDDING, SHE IS REALLY NICE AND FUNNY. SHE TELLS CRAZY STORIES. HE CLASS IS A BLAST."
Elaine  Wise,University of Louisville,English,Man I hate literature but she is an awfully good professor. I\'m currently taking her class but I decided to rate anyway. She is extremely knowledgable on the middle ages and lectures in a manner that you can understand and enjoy. Not the easiest I\'ve ever had but she is fair. UofL has a gem and probably won\'t be able to replace this one.
Barbara  Chutroo,Borough of Manhattan Community College,Psychology,I took her class in begining and dropped. I would not recommend her and can\'t believe the college would still keep her on. She is very condescending almost to the point of belittlement. Very mean...She only teaches from book and very boring. If you want a good prof. take Dr. Marcus you will learn something from him. Her class is like being in Highs
Jeffrey T.  Coster,Morgan State University,History,"Mr. Coster is my favorite professor at Morgan. Not only is he engaging with his students, but he is an EXPERT in history. He doesn\'t do boring ppts, but instead creates a presentation with photos, art, and more interesting media that entertains AND educates you (along with her corny but awesome jokes). I will take him again if I can!"
Frank  Igou,Louisiana Tech University,Psychology,He let his little grad person D.Arnold teach this class. Let me just say I learned nothing from her! I learned how one person can be very conceited tehn try to make themselves out to be the best person in the world because they feel that being difficult and failing students is just waaay cool! She is a waste of time!!
Amber  Donahue,Pennsylvania College of Technology,Mathematics,Good teacher for male\'s... not a good teacher for female\'s. read inbetween the lines....
Marion  Blute,University of Toronto at Mississauga,Sociology,"Firstly, Blute fails @ teaching. Her lectures are confusing, there was no formal textbook to help us with very difficult concepts. I learned more about biology & evolution in this class than 1st yr Anthro. TA was hot, but didn\'t help with information b/c he was restricted by prof. Seriously, I taught myself in this course, wiki was my best friend."
Debra  Bratton,Gwinnett Technical College,Mathematics,"Mrs. Bratton his a great math teacher. She has lots of patience. If you want to pass the compass, and a teacher who cares, I strongly encourage you to take her. Trust me... She even takes time out to show you how to use the calculator."
Matt  Shaughnessy,Marist College,History,"ohhhh my god he is soooo hot. he strips his windbreaker in class and reveals his banana rpublic sweater vest and bowtie. has odd obsession with women studies.... probably because hes never seen a woman naked. he likes to talk about his \'girlfriend\' and growing mustaches. he is a pushover and easily manipulated, however he does not teach material."
Jeffrey  Clark,North Dakota State University,Anthropology,"He lectures very quickly, even when you ask him to slow down. He doesn\'t post notes, you just need to write/ type quickly. There is a lot of material, and at least 4-5 chapters are covered per test. The study groups are not helpful because the TA does them and she just reads the words of the study guide, and doesn\'t know the material."
Catherine  Fraser,College of San Mateo,Business,"YAWN. I am not sure she taught me a single thing. I got very frustrated with the pace of the class and I had to challenge he a lot to squeeze a decent lesson out of the class. I honestly don\'t think she knows THAT MUCH about business, she\'s pretty knowledgeable about marketing only. DEFINITELY OVERRATED as a teacher. But she really is a nice person"
Charlotte  Young,South Plains College,Computer Science,She explains topics very well and is willing to help a student if he/she is not understanding something. She talks slowly which makes getting notes so much easier. If you pay attention and actually try it is an easy A.
Thomas  Newburg,George Mason University,English,"He came to substitute Professor Mitcho, for sure he is better than she is, he is clear and to the point, not so detailed oriented, he is an average professor, he looks naughty but he is not, he is ok, and helpful with his comments."
Emeka  Nwaeze,University of Texas at San Antonio,Accounting,Breaks down the material to a point it\'s pretty basic and easy to understand. The textbook is nearly unnecessary; save yourself the $$. Emeka is down-to-earth and helpful. Wish he tought some MS classes in the program where the instruction wasn\'t nearly as clear.
Amy  Dewitt,Shepherd University,Sociology,"She\'s awesome. If you pay attention in class and take notes, its pretty easy. DO NOT TAKE PATTERSON! I took him before Dewitt and he is awful. Dewitt made sociology interesting and relevant to students."
Mark  Damon,Westfield State University,Biology,Had him for Environmental Bio he is terrible. His class is so boring its hard to hear what her is saying and see what her is writing. The lab with him was alright. He gives you study guides with the answers on the exam. He only has 3 exams and a final which is accumulative..I personally hated him and the class.
Anita  Fabos,Clark University,International Studies,Prof. Fabos is a passionate professor. Her experience in international issues especially refugees add more weight to the content of her discussions. He appreciates the views of others and encourages her students to think critically. It was wonderful working with her.
Owen  Percy,University of Calgary,English,"Dr.Percy is a great prof. That is assuming you can handle and are not offended by his obvious and never ending sexual innuendo throughout the course. That is also assuming you are a female thus having no problem with 75% of the course being based on the ""female experience"" and how terrible the male gender is. Other than that he marks hard as well."
Sue  Prestedge,Mohawk College,Communication,"She is a neat lady, I really liked her as a teacher. She was super helpful when we needed it, he classes we always fun and we were always doing something different!"
Margaret  Voss,Pennsylvania State University - Erie,Biology,"She lays down everything as it is. She gives the information, provides examples, and expects students to read the book and keep on track with the material. She challenges her students and expects them to learn, enjoy, and remember the material she teaches. As long as you truly love biology she is an AWESOME teacher! I will never forget he lessons!"
Carolynn  Kantzler,Wayne County Community College,History,"Excellent instructor. She covers a lot of material in a short period of time, but as long as you take good notes and use he study guide you\'ll be fine. As a teacher she welcomes questions and some discussion, and never talks down to the class. If you\'re taking an intro-level history class, she\'s highly recommended."
Suzanne  Geoffroy,Cape Fear Community College,Sociology,"Rude! Grades on pet peeves and not how much you have learned about Sociology. Threatened to give me a zero for for being one line short on a one-page paper! Not helpful when I went to her to ask how I could improve, twice! Emails are extremely harsh and condescending! I went to the dept head for help, he has no backbone and refused to get involve"
Sharon  Mullane,Keiser University,Criminal Justice,"AWSOME!!!! WHEN I HAD HER SHE TOOK US TO THE COURTS IN BROWARD COUNTY, WE ALL GOT TO MEET WITH HER FRIEND ""HELP ME HOWARD"" AT HIS OFFICE. VERY CLEAR, UNDERSTANDING, AND COOL TEACHER. HER CLASS CONSISTS OF DEFINITIONS, BRIEFING CASES, AND AN EASY MIDTERM AND FINAL. JUST PAY ATTENTION AND YOU WILL BE FINE! JUST MAKE SURE YOU READ BOOK BEFORE CLASS."
Joy  St. James,Kent State University,Anthropology,"so incredibly boring. rambles on about her relatives (esp. grandkids) way too much. i\'m already sick of hearing ""the somali bantu"" and we\'re 3 classes in. i feel bad for the grad. assistant, he seems cool. and he looks like zach galifianakis."
Deepa  Aravind,College of Staten Island (CUNY - Staten Island),Management,"She\'s boring but knows her stuff. You need to pay attention and read the textbook. She takes attendance, only 3 tests and 5 articles by the end of the semester. My he first test was multiple choice and short answers but the class did poorly so she only made it multiple choice for the other tests. She\'s very nice. Would recommend. Just study."
Linda  Meltzer,Queensborough Community College,Business,Professor Meltzer is truly amazing. I had her last semester and I\'m trying to take he again. She\'s their for you when you need and she doesn\'t ask for much in return... I would definitely recommend her. She definitely knows her stuff.
Macarena  Gomez-Barris,University of Southern California,Sociology,She is very passionate about what she teaches and the lectures show her excitement. No computers allowed in her lectures unless you sit in the front. Take the class with friends so you can share notes on the reading. If I did not have a good TA I would not be doing well it he class.
Anthony  Raynsford,San Jose State University,Art History,"Attend class, take notes, and learn it without the need to open the book! Great class! Take It! 2 papers: unfortunately they are group work! but good thing is that each individual is graded on his/her own work! Great Class to Take!"
Christal  Gravett-Carrington,Pulaski Technical College,English,"She is knowledgeable about the reading/writing part of her teachings. WAY too political for me (most teachers at PTC have been). She really got down on the ""privileged"" white male in my class. Oh yeah, I had her 3 days/week and she didn\'t show up at least once a week the majority of the semester. Sometimes she sent out an email and sometimes not."
Tahmina  Morshed,Mt. San Jacinto College (all campuses),Economics,"Great teacher! 4 hw sets, to which she gives you the answers. Her tests are easy, and in some cases he will allow you to use a page of notes. NO TERM paper.If you show to class, do your hw, and take advantage of the extra credit opportunities, you will get an A. I got a B just because i missed class often. I would take her again without a doubt."
Tracy  Myhalyk,Appalachian State University,Biology,"Her tests are not too hard, she gives yout he powerpoints from class on ASULearn..so friendly and open totalk about anything;she makes everything she does relevant to the class, she reaches you about actual life lessons and not just memorizing things! She tries to open your eyes to the world but does NOT push her opinions down your throat, take her"
Melinda  Ostraff,Brigham Young University,Biology,She is great! You know exactly what you will be tested and when we all didnt do super well on the first test she let has resubmit answers. There are in class quizzes every class but they arent too hard if you study flashcards and she ends up dropping a couple. She sounded WAY better than the other guy who teaches this class!
Ling  Liu,University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire,Finance,"I\'m the guy who had to take both ACCT 201 & 202 twice, so when I heard that I had to take ACCT 312 I was very nervous. Ling Liu was the most helpful accounting teacher I\'ve ever had. She goes a little fast because there\'s a lot of info to cover but she always waits for questions after teaching. Ask questions! Few HW assignments, Exam heavy grader."
Gina  Donahoo,Florida Coastal School of Law,Lawyering Process,"Learned nothing. Sarcastic and insulting to my classmate. Give grades on kissing up curve. lies to class about their chances. IF she likes a guy, she will send him flirty emails. She talks trash about students to students. School should man up and can her. She could be a good teacher if she wanted, but she doesnt want. You will think wour doing wel"
Gina  Donahoo,Florida Coastal School of Law,Lawyering Process,"Very nice and helpful. Wants you to learn and will do a lot to make that happen. The class it self isn\'t tough as long as you do what is asked of you. As far as attendance goes, being a guy I didn\'t have a problem because she\'s eye candy."
Jean  Brouard,University of Victoria,Geography,"A great prof. Brought into replace Dr. B. Penn (while she ran for the election). He\'s a silvaculturist by trade, not a professor, so his notes are simple. Though its a 3 hour lecture slot, every week had a new guest lecturer. Final exam questions were given, and easy. Very easy to negotiate with when you\'re not happy with a grade. A GPA booster."
Regina  Gabrielle,Onondaga Community College,Sociology,"When a freshman has a better understanding of the matterial something is wrong. A student was able to out debate her in class regularly on the facts, citing material from her textbook! To combat this she stopped calling on him. At least the class wasn\'t boring."
Ren  Guo,University of Minnesota-Twin Cities,Mathematics,"I could not understand a word this man said. Not only is his English bad, but he\'s incredibly soft spoken. I sat in the second row and couldn\'t hear him! He did start using a microphone, but her was still hard to hear. If you have him, hope you have a good TA."
Lindsey  Lee,Fayetteville Technical Community College,Mathematics,"Dr. Lee is a true angel!! God knew exactly what He was doing when he created this amazing, kind-hearted woman. She\'s very thorough when she teaches, she encourages students to ask questions, and if needed - she makes herself available. Thank God that I do not have to take anymore Math classes but if I did - Dr. Lee would be my ONLY choice!!"
Lindsey  Lee,Fayetteville Technical Community College,Mathematics,"Math was never a strong point of mine and I have been out of school for quite awhile. Mrs. Lee was extremely patient and helpful with the whole class. My son was having problems converting fractions to decimals and for once, I actually could help him with this problem, thanks to Mrs. Lee! She made Math fun for me, which it had never been before!"
Vineeta  Sachdev,Los Angeles Trade Technical College,Chemistry,"If you are looking for a professor that cares about his/her student, then enroll in Professor Sachdev\'s class. All students and I mean it, everyone loved her. Everyone wished they took her for Chem 101. Amazing professor! If you do your best, you\'ll succeed. She cares about you!!"
Daniel  Disalvo,City College of New York,Political Science,"DiSalvo will stop the entire lecture if one person takes out his/her phone. SO KEEP YOUR PHONES AWAY! Great lecturer, very knowledgeable about political science. 2 papers a midterm and final. Online quizzes are easy."
