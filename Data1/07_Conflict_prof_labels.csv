Kevin  Powers,Palomar College,Welding,Very organized and answers emails. Online class and also took the math class with him. Good job just keep up with the assignments and do not get behind. Nice person and is helpful if needed. Got A in both classes.,male,conflict
Kevin  Powers,Palomar College,Welding,"Kevin is a wonderful instructor. I took welding at Palomar during the summer session at night. Being a female I was a bit worried about how I would be treated/not taken seriously. My goal was to learn welding basics in order to expand my sculpting skills. Although I had to rethink my original plans, I came away with the ability to do basic welding.",female,conflict
Kevin  Powers,Palomar College,Welding,"Super cool guy, knows welding and understands what he is teaching. Lectures are useful, gives notes outlined in power point. Quizzes are easy and open note/book final. Is always willing to help students and do one on one demos. Would definately take him again.",male,conflict
Maureen  Demaio,University of California Santa Barbara,Music,"I love her. Very fun-loving, incredibly smart, and caring. Papers are challenging, but in a very good way, and she WILL help you with it if you are struggling at all. (Forces you to go to see her to pick up your papers.) Easy to talk to. Best writing teacher and best teacher I\'ve ever had at UCSB. I highly recommend her for Writing 2.",female,conflict
Maureen  Demaio,University of California Santa Barbara,Music,"She is an absolutely amazing teacher! I loved every thing about her class, although sometimes the papers were a little frustrating due to their complicated nature. Her office hours are extremely helpful though and she is extremely accommodating for meeting times outside of class. If you tell her what\'s up, she will find a way to help you.",female,conflict
Maureen  Demaio,University of California Santa Barbara,Music,"Not only was she extremely open and helpful throughout the quarter, willing to answer any questions, but she is the nicest person and very relatable. The writing class wasn\'t too hard, just follow all instructions she provides and ask ANY questions you ever have. Great teacher, she will be missed next quarter! Make sure to get her as your teacher.",female,conflict
Maureen  Demaio,University of California Santa Barbara,Music,easy class. The lectures were extremely unorganized which was annoying. Good for GE\'s.,unknown,conflict
Maureen  Demaio,University of California Santa Barbara,Music,I took this class just for GEs but what I got out of it was so much more. I learned SO much. Maureen is an AMAZING professor who truly cares for her students. She really wants you to do well & is always available outside of class. She\'s super funny too. Too bad she isn\'t teaching Mus15 anymore b/c I would\'ve recommend it to everyone!,female,conflict
Maureen  Demaio,University of California Santa Barbara,Music,"AWESOME!!! Love her. Too bad I\'m a senior and can\'t still be a music minor, cause she definitely made me want to be. Vincent was hysterical, tough grader though. She\'s teaching Writing 2 next Fall and I HIGHLY recommend her!",female,conflict
Maureen  Demaio,University of California Santa Barbara,Music,"Maureen is very sweet and enthusiastic. She loves what she is doing and will go out of her way to help everyone. It helps to go to lecture... I never used the book. Not once, it is useless, but you do need the CDs for the class. As long as you study before the test and practice for the listening portion you will score an easy A.",female,conflict
Maureen  Demaio,University of California Santa Barbara,Music,"Really easy class. Tests are a joke, but you still need to study the material to do well. Whether you get an A or a B really depends on your TA, which I didn\'t think was very fair, but that\'s life. Concert reports are annoying but easy. Maureen is a very nice lady. Unfortunately she is no longer teaching Mus15 after this quarter :(",female,conflict
Maureen  Demaio,University of California Santa Barbara,Music,"Maureen is one of the best professors ive had at UCSB. Shes a great lecturer and loves meeting her students in office hours. Pretty easy if you\'re willing to put a bit of time in. Sasha is a great TA too. 3 short papers and a few section assignments. Required to attend 2 concerts. overall, great class!",female,conflict
Maureen  Demaio,University of California Santa Barbara,Music,"She\'s def a good prof, makes the notes clear and helps u remember the musical devices. As a music minor, it wasn\'t hard for me, even for those taking it to fulfill their Arts req its pretty easy. Fulfills writing req broken up into 3 short papers which rly helps. Vincent isn\'t that bad of a TA, if u go to office hrs he rly helps u on the paper.",female,conflict
Maureen  Demaio,University of California Santa Barbara,Music,Super nice and very approachable. Thought class was very interesting and Maureen has a way of keeping students involved in lectures. good class to take,unknown,conflict
Maureen  Demaio,University of California Santa Barbara,Music,"Maureen is definitely one of the most upbeat professors i\'ve had so far. Would be an easy class if I didn\'t have Vincent as my TA...he grades unfairly on papers and all other TA\'s give out A\'s like there\'s no tomorrow. Other than that, it\'s a fun class with information i\'m never going to use outside class but It\'s a good unit and GE filler.",male,conflict
Maureen  Demaio,University of California Santa Barbara,Music,"Very nice lady, fun lectures, a relief going to this class. Just don\'t say you heard the first piece of your concert when you really showed up ten minutes late and made up the fact that they tuned before. She\'ll report you to the Office of Judicial Affairs and give you a Zero. Shoot. Other than that, easy A, fun class.",female,conflict
Maureen  Demaio,University of California Santa Barbara,Music,"This class is pretty easy and Maureen is very nice. She tends to treat the class like kindergartners, but that\'s not really a bad thing. There are 3 papers but they\'re really not very hard. Go to lecture because the tests are all on her lectures, not the book. If you are struggling, the TAs and Maureen are all very helpful!I recommend the class",female,conflict
Maureen  Demaio,University of California Santa Barbara,Music,"Maureen is definitely a breath of fresh air. This is her first quarter teaching and like how she tries hard to make connections with the course material and the students. She can be a little scatter-brained, but what Music Professor isn\'t? She\'s great and I\'d recommend the class to anyone.",female,conflict
Lindsey  Wilkinson,Portland State University,University Studies,"Lindsey is the type of teacher that will help and assist you so long as you reach out to him. His class is well-organized and he is always prepared for any questions/concerns. He adds humor to the classroom, which is a bonus to creating a fun environment. In terms of his workload, to put it simply: read, research, write, and repeat.",male,conflict
Lindsey  Wilkinson,Portland State University,University Studies,"Lindsey is an extremely friendly and well-organized teacher. He is very understanding and loves to help you out if you are feeling lost. However, this doesn\'t mean you can slack off. Lots of writing assignments but clear expectations. Great teacher and inspirational man :)",male,conflict
Lindsey  Wilkinson,Portland State University,University Studies,"Lindsey Wilkinson is a great teacher. He tries his best to help his students succeed in class. If you read all the assigned readings on time, you\'ll get an easy A. However, prepare yourself for group projects. I got an A- because my group couldn\'t collaborate well and were lazy in completing their assigned work.",male,conflict
Lindsey  Wilkinson,Portland State University,University Studies,"There were many assignments to do throughout the course, but as long as you read the material than it is fairly easy. She had great lectures for an online class, and the readings were very scholarly and fun to read. I recommend if you don\'t mind somewhat of a heavy workload.",female,conflict
Lindsey  Wilkinson,Portland State University,University Studies,"2 tests, 2 response papers. 2 extra credits opportunity. tests are same as study guides. in class assignments; goes over the class assignments before having students turning it in. don\'t buy the books; waste of $$. i never touched it. they only want you to read to have in class discussions but i don\'t participate.",unknown,conflict
Lindsey  Wilkinson,Portland State University,University Studies,"Tough class, first of all she is very unclear on assignments and due dates. Her tests are confusing and review sheets are even more so confusing. I was lost the whole term and when I met up with her she just mumbled and didn\'t really help me understand. She seemed very uncomfortable the whole term and like she just wanted to leave.",female,conflict
Lindsey  Wilkinson,Portland State University,University Studies,"Lindsey is a wonderful prof. Contrary to most reviewers Lindsy is a guy, by the way. He offered about 20 points of extra credit to our class, so that was awesome. He has very clear guidelines and expectations for class assignments and even posted some examples. Exams should be studied for, but aren\'t too difficult. Would take his class again.",male,conflict
Lindsey  Wilkinson,Portland State University,University Studies,"I loved Lindsey\'s class & her as a teacher. She kept it interesting & entertaining & genuinely seemed to care about her students. She is very straight forward with her expectations & extremely helpful. I cannot talk her up enough. It was an easy A, but I found myself absorbing more info than usual because of her knack for relevant topic selection.",female,conflict
Lindsey  Wilkinson,Portland State University,University Studies,"I really enjoyed this class because of the content and the discussions that went on in class. Our response papers were basically up to us to give our opinions. The guidelines and assignments for this course were pretty unclear, and sometimes the professor tended to mumble and talk too fast, but other than that I really enjoyed the class.",unknown,conflict
Lindsey  Wilkinson,Portland State University,University Studies,Pretty good teacher. Allowed a note card for the test. Explained topics well with interesting media (like video clips and stuff) to help illustrate points.,unknown,conflict
Lindsey  Wilkinson,Portland State University,University Studies,This is the easiest class I have taken at PSU. She is really funny and makes class enjoyable. The study guide were the exact questions for the tests and we went over it in class. Take her class!,female,conflict
Lindsey  Wilkinson,Portland State University,University Studies,"I liked this class. Lindsey is quite knowledgeable and friendly. 2 multiple choice exams, 6 in class assignments, 2 short response papers. Lectures are a little boring sometimes because they are straight power point from the text. Tests are honestly a little too easy for my liking. Overall though, I enjoyed it and learned a good deal.",unknown,conflict
Lindsey  Wilkinson,Portland State University,University Studies,"Interesting course, interesting professor. Honestly, if you printed out the powerpoints, you didn\'t need to do the course reading because she went over it all in lecture. She\'s funny and intelligent. As some people mentioned, she does read off her slides, she also can answer any question that she\'s asked. Plenty of opportunity for extra credit.",female,conflict
Lindsey  Wilkinson,Portland State University,University Studies,"This class was so easy! You just had to show up, listen, and you got an A. She assigns readings for every class, but you don\'t need to read them because she goes over them in class. Also, her class was always so funny and interesting! It was my favorite class this term! I definitely recommend her class!",female,conflict
Lindsey  Wilkinson,Portland State University,University Studies,"Interesting class. Professor is informative & clear but keeps it fun. Posts all lectures on D2L. Utilizes the textbook, other readings, films, & online articles. Attendance not mandatory & it\'s hard not to do well in this class. I recommend it.",unknown,conflict
Lindsey  Wilkinson,Portland State University,University Studies,I loved the class! Her powerpoints are very straightforward and her expectations are as well. Personable lecturer and her assignments are pretty easy. Reading for most classes but she goes over them in detail during class so I haven\'t done much of it at all and got a 96% on the midterm. Overall great!,female,conflict
Lindsey  Wilkinson,Portland State University,University Studies,"For people to say that she is unclear about what she wants is crazy, she is super clear about what she wants. She drives home all of the things she expects you to know in class. She is felxible about many things, you just have to talk to her, and yes she does respond to emails. She may mumble from time to time, but I would definitely recommend her",female,conflict
Lindsey  Wilkinson,Portland State University,University Studies,"I like the professor. She is very knowledgeable, nice and has a sense of humor. I would recommend her.",female,conflict
Lindsey  Wilkinson,Portland State University,University Studies,"It is difficult to not get an A+ in this course. Super-easy and the professor is really nice. There were four different books which altogether cost me $60, I quit reading them after week three. You do need them for the last assignment though, which is easy. Easy to get points as long as you show up to class from time to time.",unknown,conflict
Lindsey  Wilkinson,Portland State University,University Studies,"I took Marriage & Intimacy, a sociology class for the family studies cluster. This class was really easy as long as you did the work and paid attention. Reading every assigned passage in the textbook isn\'t really necessary as long as you get a basic idea. Her exams are easy. She has a good sense of humor, too.",female,conflict
Henry  McDade,Shelton State Community College,Psychology,"i\'m very interested in the subject, but i feel like he was a bit boring.

Henry  McDade,Shelton State Community College,Psychology,I disagree with prior comments.I carry 22 hrs and managed an A on 1st test. It is ridiculous to post neg comments on prof after 4 weeks. All lecture outlines are available on pwr pt; he answers all e-mails promptly; he curved 1st test very student friendly. What more do you want? Dr. McDade is composed & considerate.

Henry  McDade,Shelton State Community College,Psychology,Take class at Harvard or Yale it will be much easier. Tests are insane and unfair. Tough material w/o much help. no test review/no study guide/no xtra credit/quiz offered as punishment. Anyone this boring should be more helpful. Went into class loving psych with A\'s in 3 prev Psy classes; He\'s almost succeeded in ruining psy for me.,male,conflict
Henry  McDade,Shelton State Community College,Psychology,WARNING!Ridiculously hard prof holds you accountable for entire book including what he never talks about + online summary + Obscure lecture points..refuses to offer study guide or reveiew for test..enjoys keeping you in the dark. Test ? worded very poorly..If you value your gpa and career stay away from this guy...you have been forewarned,male,conflict
Henry  McDade,Shelton State Community College,Psychology,Very old school teacher who feels the harder he makes class the better teacher he is.

Nicole  Maurantonio,University of Richmond,Communication Studies,Dr. Maurantonio is brilliant and nice to talk to.

Very active in working for students of disadvantaged backgrounds.,female,conflict
Nicole  Maurantonio,University of Richmond,Communication Studies,"She\'s nice and approachable, but also knows her stuff. The readings, screenings, and paper topics are interesting and good for both RHCS-majors and gen electives. Class is heavily discussion based, with her serving as a moderator/agenda setter, which occasionally gets repetitive. Not hard to succeed, but put in the work and you will learn as well.",female,conflict
Nicole  Maurantonio,University of Richmond,Communication Studies,"Had her for FYS Cops, Crime, and Popular Culture. It was a very interesting class. She is somewhat of a tough grader, but she provides great feedback and always welcomes you to her office. She gives 11 reading quizzes, but you are allowed to drop your lowest grade. There are no tests in the class and the longest paper is 4-5 pages.",female,conflict
Nicole  Maurantonio,University of Richmond,Communication Studies,"I had her for the FYS Cops, Crime, and Popular culture, and she is an amazing woman and teacher!

She is awesome and so interesting!! Hope i can take her again.",female,conflict
Nicole  Maurantonio,University of Richmond,Communication Studies,"I had her for my FYS, and I have to say, it was awesome! She was fun and energetic, and it was a very easy A. I would definitely take a class with her again.",female,conflict
Nicole  Maurantonio,University of Richmond,Communication Studies,"This class is definitely not the easy A it used to be. She revamped her course and now just arbitrarily gives out grades. The discussions are very circuitous and boring...difficult to stay awake. Pop quizzes once a week, one paper, blog posts throughout the semester, a midterm, and a cumulative final.",female,conflict
Nicole  Maurantonio,University of Richmond,Communication Studies,"A little bit frustrating. Asks discussion questions in class and instead of giving a response says ""yeah, no, yeah, totally, definitely"" Never fails. Pretty easy though, lectures can get boring.",unknown,conflict
Nicole  Maurantonio,University of Richmond,Communication Studies,"Okay class, pretty easy. She\'s a nice person and seems to want everyone to do well. THe material is boring as ****, but she manages to liven it up w random youtube clips and whatnot.

Nicole  Maurantonio,University of Richmond,Communication Studies,"Um, I have no idea what that last guy was talking about, but I was in that class and I think that I know who wrote it. Hilarious!

Nicole  Maurantonio,University of Richmond,Communication Studies,"Shouldn\'t be teaching. She\'s fresh out of grad school and at some times was completely overmatched by intelligent students who don\'t agree with her. Her tests were confusing and she often made mistakes on them. Also she\'s very liberal and if you aren\'t completely to the left, make sure to censor your opinions.",female,conflict
Nicole  Maurantonio,University of Richmond,Communication Studies,"She is an amazing professor.

She also uses clips from SNL and the Daily Show.",female,conflict
Gwynn  Markle,Orange Coast College,Philosophy,"Dr. Markle is a good instructor. It is the material that is difficult. It is helpful to read the chapters several times before exams.

He is willing to help students before and after class.",male,conflict
Gwynn  Markle,Orange Coast College,Philosophy,"You MUST listen/read all online lectures and thoroughly read through the chapters in order to understand this class and pass the quizzes.

Michelle  Morgan,Rochester Institute of Technology,Biology,"She makes it very clear what you need to study for each quiz and practical.

Erica  Tyler,Folsom Lake College,Anthropology,"Took her online anthro300 class, it was very organized and predictable.

Erica  Tyler,Folsom Lake College,Anthropology,It was easy if you follow the syllabus and watch the weekly class recordings.

I don\'t know why people are saying it was so hard to get an A, I got an A in both classes and am not a very physical person. He\'s also incredibly beautiful, so there\'s that.",male,conflict
Travers  Breen,Suffolk County Community College,Physical Education,"Pretty funny guy and also really laid back. Backpacking was extremely simple, the written/oral presentations were easy, the day hikes were brief, and the overnight camp out/hike was fun. Wished there was more day hikes like the actual hiking class, but the camp out made up for it.",male,conflict
Travers  Breen,Suffolk County Community College,Physical Education,"He is a nice guy, and has a laid back personality that made going to Tennis fun. But his final exam was much harder than expected, even though I studied for it thoroughly. Overall his class was fun, but it seems that getting an A in his class is difficult even if you attend each class.",male,conflict

Jean  Brouard,University of Victoria,Geography,"One of my favorite classes and profs thus far. A great subject that is very relevant here in BC. Jean is very friendly, knowledgeable, and fair, with a tendency to go off on tangents, which can be interesting. Lots of guest lecturers, some better than others. There are two essays, and a final exam and the evaluation was flexible and more than fair.",unknown,conflict
Jean  Brouard,University of Victoria,Geography,"Jean is the funniest and most random professor. He is so knowledgable about everything, especially forestry. Made a 3 hour forestry lecture almost enjoyable. Marks essays fairly and allows you to redo.",male,conflict
Jean  Brouard,University of Victoria,Geography,"One of my favourite profs at Uvic. A very knowledgeable teacher who is approachable and available for help outside of class. He marks essays fair, and will let you redo if u aren\'t satisfied. He has real-life practical knowledge which helps.",male,conflict
Jean  Brouard,University of Victoria,Geography,"A great prof. Brought into replace Dr. B. Penn (while she ran for the election). He\'s a silvaculturist by trade, not a professor, so his notes are simple. Though its a 3 hour lecture slot, every week had a new guest lecturer. Final exam questions were given, and easy. Very easy to negotiate with when you\'re not happy with a grade. A GPA booster.",female,conflict
