        "We categorized each student comment into three rating groups based on the `student_star` score: **negative** (1.0-2.5), **neutral** (3.0), and **positive** (3.5-5.0). Out of 19,685 total comments, the vast majority (13,615, \\~69\\%) fall into the positive group, reflecting generally high student satisfaction. The negative group comprises 4,862 comments (\\~25\\%), while the neutral group is the smallest with 1,195 comments (\\~6\\%).\n",
        "\n",
        "Comments in the positive group are associated with 2,481 unique professors across 1,064 schools and 251 unique tag labels, and exhibit a mean `student_star` of 4.62 and median of 5.0. The negative group includes 1,544 professors from 807 schools, with a mean rating of 1.56 and median of 1.5, indicating strong dissatisfaction. The neutral group, with mean and median exactly at 3.0, spans 802 professors and 490 schools.\n",
        "\n",
        "This distribution indicates a pronounced skew toward positive evaluations, but substantial variability exists across professors and schools. Notably, the negative and neutral groups still cover a wide range of departments and tag labels, suggesting that even lower-rated comments are spread across diverse academic contexts rather than being isolated to a few instructors or courses. This preliminary categorization will serve as the basis for further analysis of text features and gendered perception in student evaluations."
